After the fight with the crew of the <Link to="/">Celeste Noir</Link> Demetrius moved the ship to a nearby cove he spotted as they were sailing in. The party got some light rest — with Cotash keeping watch during the night — they woke before dawn and set out to Gatherhold slipping into town before the sun rose and made their way to The Hole In The Wall. Demetrius stayed behind with the ship to guard it.

Tara greeted the party with her typical welcoming spirit. The two goblins were there again as well, playing the same dice game in the same seats. Cotash gave Tara a friendly greeting and dove down into the basement — unlocking the wall with an arrow of his own — and the party following behind.

Cotash and the party caught Nesah up on the events of the night prior. The news troubled Nesah. She agreed with the conclusion Natsuko came to: this is likely the work of madness and a Cult of The Dragon Below. Nesah was also concerned with the disappearance of Aubrey, but let the party know that The Silver Flame has means of tracking they can resort to; House Tharashk will gladly cooperate for a fee.

### Presenting the party with a choice

Nesah thanks the party for their work in dealing with some potential members of a Cult of The Dragon Below, concerned that it the cult may have infiltrated House Cannith, and is spreading — she also gives the party some options. She doesn't expect the party to get involved in this fight, but, if they choose to do so The Silver Flame can and will compensate them well for their efforts.

Regardless of their decision she does ask to study the sundial. Despite it being recently made it looks heavily based on ancient artifacts from The Age of Dhakaan ( A span of 10,000 years 15,000 to 5,000 years ago). It will take her time to inspect — a few days to a couple of weeks. She can cover the tab of the party if they choose to stay in town at The Hole In The Wall. She will also send word out The Silver Flame, seeing if they have any reports of cult activity similar to what twas observed.

### What to do with the downtime:

- _Level up!_ You're all level 7 now, and I'm happy to help you with your leveling.
- _Train, study, advance:_ there is a small library in Gatherhold, and a few specialists in town.
- _Shop:_ There are merchants of all kind in Gatherhold, with many passing through each day.
- _Investigate:_ House Cannith has a stronghold about five miles east of town. You may go and see if there's any cult activity there.
- _Relax:_ rest and relax in town.
- _Travel:_ Within reason the party can try to talk [[:demetrius-d-lyrandar | Demetrius ]] in to using The Celeste Noir to travel somewhere in the area. It would be wise to help disguise the ship somehow though.

### One week of travel on the airship.
