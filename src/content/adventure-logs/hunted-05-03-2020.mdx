The party returned to Gatherhold during a cold winter morning with captives in tow and questions aplenty. They headed for The Hole in the Wall, sending Cotash away to help guard the Celeste as they attended to matters in town. Below the in they spoke with Nesah about their findings. She clarified that the bracer is indeed old, and that it looks like the shards can be swapped out for others.

As they were getting answers from Nesah trouble struck. A small strike team of two cultists, an assassin, and a bounty hunter from House Tharashk had shown up at the inn, possibly tracking something. During the fight an Intellect Devourer worked itâ€™s way out of the mind of one of the cultists. Nesah let the group know the presence of such a creature is a very bad sign.

The party has decided to head to Sharn, where they can hide in plain sight, and hopefully find the next item before the cult gets any closer.
