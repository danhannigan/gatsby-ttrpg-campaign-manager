All the halfling tribes come to Gatherhold to trade, hold councils, and settle disputes. House Ghallanda maintains the town, but Gatherhold belongs to the people, not the houses. Other dragonmarked houses offer their services here as well. The town is on the shore of Lake Cyre, and once people came by boat through Cyre; now the Mourning has cut off that passage.
