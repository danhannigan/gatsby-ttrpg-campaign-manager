Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren’t a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What’s more, you aren’t alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u succeed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves’ guilds and street gangs. You might be a “velvet mask” bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn’s great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar — any place that’s large enough to have a steady supply of potential<span class=\"No-Break\"> quarries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn’t fit with the group’s objectives — but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your c<span class=\"No-Break\">ompanions.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong> Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd Stealth<br></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thie<span class=\"No-Break\">ves’ tools<br></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Equipment:</span></strong> A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a pouch contai<span class=\"No-Break\">ning 20 gp</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: EAR TO THE GROUND</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through.

        "shortDescription": "<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren’t a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What’s more, you aren’t alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u succeed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves’ guilds and street gangs. You might be a “velvet mask” bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn’s great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar — any place that’s large enough to have a steady supply of potential<span class=\"No-Break\"> quarries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn’t fit with the group’s objectives — but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your c<span class=\"No-Break\">ompanions.</span></p>",

Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children.

You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere.

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion.

These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing.

If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the g<span class=\"No-Break\">uild’s coffers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild.

Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop.

It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your ret<span class=\"No-Break\">urn to society.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact o<span class=\"No-Break\">n the campaign.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faerûn aren’t bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, <span class=\"No-Break\">and heart.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn’t necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in th<span class=\"No-Break\">e faction.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as appropriate to yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur faction<br></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Languages:</span></strong> Two of y<span class=\"No-Break\">our choice<br></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Equipment:</span></strong> Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch contai<span class=\"No-Break\">ning 15 gp</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Factions of the Sword Coast</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Lords’ Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true i<span class=\"No-Break\">dentities.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Suggested Characteristics</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Use the tables for the acolyte background below&nbsp;as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent.

To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each<span class=\"No-Break\"> location.</span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Reason</th>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Reason</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Emissary</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Pilgrim</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Exile</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Sightseer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Fugitive</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Wanderer</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Where Are You From?</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faerûn.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you have.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span class=\"No-Break\">e a child.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Feature: All Eyes on You</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd people.<br></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;Suggested Characteristics&nbsp;</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others’ space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don’t comprehend.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Open.</span> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks.

On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their w<span class=\"No-Break\">eaknesses.</span> <br><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Knights of Myth Drannor.</span></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond.

By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom.

        "description": "<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could<span class=\"No-Break\"> be your bond.)</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<dl>\n<dt><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;History, Persuasion</dt>\n<dt><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</dt>\n<dt><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</dt>\n<dt><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</dt>\n</dl>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>FEATURE: RETAINERS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body-Last--apply-at-last-paragraph-\">You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family.

        "shortDescription": "<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could<span class=\"No-Break\"> be your bond.)</span></p>",

It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark.
