Following the revelations that Nesah had the party heads to Q’barra – towards an ancient Couatl city & temple that she knows about. Travel takes five days.

Once they reach the area and being searching Celeste is pulled to the overgrown and old temple via visual artifacts appearing like shimmering gold light. Her celestial nature allows her to open the temple door. The party descends into the temple and is met by a formidable stone guardian – after a brief fight and some recuperation Celeste solves the puzzle by using her radiant ability – sprouting wings and showing to the guardian that she is a celestial creature. It moves aside, giving them the gift of a small polished Eberron shard.

In the next room they make a small offering of blood, reflecting the sacrifice that the couatl made to create the Silver Flame, and in exchange get a polished Khyber shard.

After that they go to the final chamber – and discover a bracer with a Siberys dragon shard in it. At the same time they reach the bracer invaders enter the temple, which locks the bracer in. The party faces off against two new threats: Dolgrums and Dolgaunts – as well as some old friends: Mia Thail Valdana d’Lyrandar and Aubrey Galatea. They defeat all of the monsters, retrieve the new bracer, and board the ship – heading back to Gatherhold.

The trip back to Gatherhold takes five days.
